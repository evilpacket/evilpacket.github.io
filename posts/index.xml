      <description>This last week Nick Starke got the chrome debugger metasploit module pushed over the line and merged into master. I figured I&#39;d write up a quick intro to the module and how it might be used should you happen to stumble across a chrome debugger laying around the network.

      <description>While following the Setting Up a Metasploit Development Environment I ran into a few hiccups. Hopefully somebody else won&#39;t stumble if I write it down and share it.
Error: ruby-build: definition not found: 2.6.2 I think originally I was on an ubuntu system but I also ran into this when developing from Kali Linux.
apt-get remove ruby-build git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git cd ruby-build sudo ./install.sh rbev issues rbev wasn&#39;t installed on my system right either.</description>
